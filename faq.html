                    <h2>How does a random number generator work for the lottery?</h2>
                    <p>Our generator uses JavaScript's Math.random() to produce pseudo-random numbers within the official range for each game. For Powerball, it picks 5 unique numbers from 1–69 plus a Powerball from 1–26. For Mega Millions, it picks 5 from 1–70 plus a Mega Ball from 1–25. Every combination has an equal chance of being selected.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2>What are the odds of winning the Powerball jackpot?</h2>
                    <p>The odds of matching all 5 numbers plus the Powerball are approximately <strong>1 in 292.2 million</strong>. For Mega Millions, the odds are about <strong>1 in 302.6 million</strong>. These odds are the same regardless of which numbers you choose — random picks have the same probability as "lucky" numbers.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2>What is the most common Powerball number?</h2>
                    <p>While certain numbers appear more frequently in historical draws, every number has an equal probability of being drawn in any given game. Past frequency does not predict future results. Our tool generates numbers randomly, giving every combination an equal chance.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2>Can I use this generator to pick my lottery ticket numbers?</h2>
                    <p>Yes. The tool uses official Powerball and Mega Millions number ranges and generates truly random combinations. Many players use random generators instead of choosing their own numbers. However, no method increases your actual odds of winning.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2>What is the difference between Powerball and Mega Millions?</h2>
                    <p>Powerball draws 5 white balls from 1–69 plus a red Powerball from 1–26. Mega Millions draws 5 white balls from 1–70 plus a gold Mega Ball from 1–25. Both games have drawings multiple times per week, with jackpots starting at $20 million and often growing into hundreds of millions.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2>Are "hot" or "cold" lottery numbers more likely to win?</h2>
                    <p>No. Each lottery drawing is an independent event. A number that has appeared frequently ("hot") or rarely ("cold") in the past has exactly the same probability of being drawn next time. This is a common misconception known as the <em>Gambler's Fallacy</em>. Our generator treats every number equally.</p>
